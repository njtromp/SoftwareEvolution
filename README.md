## Clone instructions
Since this repository only contains the Rascal sourcefiles, and not any of the Eclipse meta-data files you have to follow the steps below when cloning this project.
* Clone the project into your prefered location
* Create a Rascal project and deselect the 'Use default location' checkbox.
* Use the 'Browse' botton to navigate to the project folder (Session0 or Session1) that is within the cloned repository and click 'Open'.
* Now you can either use 'Next' or 'Finish' to finalize the creation of your project.

## Starting a Rascal (REPL) terminal.
Sometimes when the Rascal terminal keeps complaining about 'Could not import module <<modulename>>: can not find in search path', here is what you can do.
* Right-click on the 'src' folder and select 'Rascal Console'.

Have fun.
